# Awesome Aberdeen

A curated list of my favourite awesome, unique, independent places and things in Aberdeen City and Shire.

## ‚òïÔ∏è Caf√©s & Coffee Shops

* [Mad Penguin](https://www.facebook.com/madpenguingelato/) - An artisan gelateria and some of the best coffee in the city.
* [The Coffee Apothecary](http://www.thecoffeeapothecary.co.uk/) - A lovely wee caf√© in Udny, probably *the* best coffee in the Shire.

## ‚õ∞ Exploring

* [Bennachie](http://scotland.forestry.gov.uk/visit/bennachie-centre) - A very prominent hill with awesome views across Aberdeenshire. Great for trail running (there's a hill race), dog walking, hiking, biking, or just a general bumble about. There's a *lot* to explore and some secrets to discover.
* [Kirkhill Forest](http://scotland.forestry.gov.uk/visit/kirkhill) - If you can't get to Bennachie then Kirkhill is the next best thing practically in Aberdeen. There's a 20-something point orientiering course, a mountain bike fun park (although the unofficial trails are more fun), walks and a tower to discover.
* [Tyrebagger Forest](http://scotland.forestry.gov.uk/visit/tyrebagger) - Right across the road from Kirkhill, Tyrebagger is the smaller brother. You'll find some very easy walks, a slightly more technical walk, and some intreguing sculptures. 

## üé® Creative & Arts

* [Peacock Visual Arts](http://www.peacockvisualarts.com/) - *The* place for contemporary art in Aberdeen, its been around for decades now and always worth a nosey.
* [MAKE](http://www.make-aberdeen.com/) - A ‚Äúdigital fabrication‚Äù studio on Belmont Street, they can do 3D scanning and printing which is always cool.

## üê∂ Animals & Pets

* [Mrs Murrays Cat & Dog Home](http://www.mrsmurrays.co.uk/) - They care for lost and stray dogs and cats, and help rehome animals.
* [Willows Animal Sanctuary](http://www.willowsanimals.com/) - An animal sanctuary, what's better than that?
* [The Cat in the Window Caf√©](http://www.thecatinthewindowcafe.com/) - Aberdeen's first ever Cat Caf√©!
